Project: Business Rivalry Simulation - iOS vs Android (Prisoner's Dilemma)
Description:
This project simulates the competitive dynamics between iOS and Android using the principles of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The project models how strategic decisions made by both companies (cooperation or defection) impact their long-term success. By applying game theory, it analyzes the outcomes of various strategies and how they shape the market's equilibrium. The simulation provides insights into real-world business rivalry and competitive decision-making.

Features:
Simulation of business strategies using the Prisoner's Dilemma.
Payoff matrix to visualize and compare outcomes of cooperation and defection.
Analysis of multiple rounds to explore long-term effects of competition.
Customizable parameters for different strategies.
Technologies Used:
Python: For implementing the simulation and game theory logic.
NumPy: To handle numerical operations for calculating payoffs and managing matrices.
Matplotlib: For visualizing results and outcomes of different strategies.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis of results.
Jupyter Notebook: To run and document the simulation process interactively.
